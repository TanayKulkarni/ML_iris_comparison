This is one of the most basic programs in machine learning that implements the concept of supervised learning.
This program basically compares the accuracy of three most common algorithms namely naive_bayes, decision_tree and random_forest.
Iris is an inbuilt dataset that you get in sklearn. Thus importing datasets is not a challenge.This is a great way to start learning machine learning algorithms and understand its applications.
